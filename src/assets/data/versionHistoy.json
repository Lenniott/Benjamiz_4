Initially, I was unsure of its value against other possible features. With only a few support logs [around 7 per quarter], the frequent feature requests highlighted a demand. I suspected users made changes they later wished to undo, finding it easier to redo the work than navigate support. User interviews confirmed this; when asked about reversing major changes, most had a story to share. Considering our goals and the feature's simplicity, we moved forward. As the development team worked on backend storage for versions, I looked into how users would find and revert to older versions."
