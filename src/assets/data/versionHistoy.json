Our objective this year as a product team was to deliver a road map of highly requested and valuable features to regain customer support and trust in the product."

Initially, I was unsure of its value against other possible features. With only a few support logs [around 7 per quarter], the frequent feature requests highlighted a demand. I suspected users made changes they later wished to undo, finding it easier to redo the work than navigate support. User interviews confirmed this; when asked about reversing major changes, most had a story to share. Considering our goals and the feature's simplicity, we moved forward. As the development team worked on backend storage for versions, I looked into how users would find and revert to older versions."

This was because our content page editors—either in-house learning designers or university staff—commonly used Google Docs and Microsoft Word. I included Figma in the analysis, anticipating that its status as a design tool meant it had a refined history function. This approach aimed to ensure the feature would meet user expectations, which would be shaped by their familiarity with similar features from other platforms. Finally, with the help of users, I looked at other online learning platforms’ attempts at version history."

The responses varied, with some finding the feature without guidance and others struggling. I noticed variations in the time it took users to find the feature and their approaches, but overall, I found it acceptable for release. Once users located it, they agreed it was placed logically and found it clear. Since our platform lacks a feature to highlight and educate users on new updates, provided we made our release notes and support documents clear, accessible, and well-distributed, we would be able to minimise the risk of the feature being overlooked by users. I shared these insights and recommendations with the product manager and customer support lead."

I had concerns about users potentially spam-saving and losing earlier versions, but after a review, we found that pages were saved on average 20-25 times. So, setting the limit at 50 appeared to be a reasonable choice."

Our platform's unique selling point is our activity bank, crucial for student engagement. Effective learning experiences often involve a variety of learning modalities, including text, video, and interactive elements. Online, this typically means blending these formats. However, activities on our platform are implemented as iframes. While the history feature could track the presence and placement of activity, it couldn't capture the content within those iframes because it was external to the data saved by our text editor."
